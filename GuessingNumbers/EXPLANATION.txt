The problem is to guess what number a computer has in mind. Program randomly generates an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive. 
The program prompts the user to enter a number continuously until the number matches the randomly generated number. 
For each user input, the program tells the user whether the input is too low or too high, so the user
can make the next guess intelligently
